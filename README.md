# xmmpy

Repository with files relevant to XMM data processing, calibration and analysis

You need to have `XMM-SAS` set up (i.e. you have access to the XMM-SAS tasks from within python or the notebook, i.e. executing `!sasversions` in a cell should not fail). You also need `HEADAS` built with `pyXspec` and initialised from the terminal where you start `jupyter lab`.

Subfolders:

`notebooks`: jupyterlab notebooks
