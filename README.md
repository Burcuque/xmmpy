# xmmpy

Repository with files relevant to XMM data processing, calibration and analysis

You need to have `XMM-SAS` set up (i.e. you have access to the XMM-SAS tasks from within python or the notebook). You also need `HEADAS` built with `pyXSpec`.

Subfolders:

`notebooks`: jupyterlab notebooks, subfolders for calibration and simulations

`scripts`: python scripts for XMM data processing and analysis.
